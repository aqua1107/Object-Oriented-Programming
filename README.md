## 📖 About The Project

This is a collection of exercises, mini-projects, and design pattern implementations. The goal is to master the art of writing **"Pythonic"** classes and understanding the architecture behind scalable applications.

I focus on moving beyond basic syntax to understand how objects interact, inherit, and encapsulate data to solve real-world problems.
